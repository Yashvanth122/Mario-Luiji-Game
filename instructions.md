Pmario Battle
===
Welcome mushroom kingdom to the even we've all been waiting for, the battle royale between the two pesky plumbers proving pointless princess participation....

On the left of the screen, the older brother who gets all the attention, yes, it's-a-him, PMaaaaaaaaaarrrriioooooooooo

On the right of the screen, with no appearances in smash brothers, but his own haunted mansion.... Pluuuuuuuuuuuuuijiiiiiiiiii

Coder, please finish the game so the epic battle can commence


Implement the following in the code:
-----
* Frames per second - using the clock object, accessing the object's function clock.tick() - 16:25 in the video
* Single Keyboard controls for both players (wasd for pluiji and arrow keys for the pmario)
* Bullets
    * Only 3 on screen for each player at a time
    * Shoot just like the space ships in the video (not affected by gravity)
* Display health score on screen 1:16:30 in the video
* Displays who wins and restarts the game like in the video

Bonus implementation: 
* Use the fireball.png for bullets
* Have fireballs bounce like balls (bouncing ball assignment) or like in the original
* Create a platform players can jump onto (handling collisions (cancelling gravity, enabling landed, etc))
* Flip image and shooting direction when walking backwards
* Random Goomba walking back and forth at the bottom of the screen that subtracts health for either player


Remember, if you find it hard to find the section in the video that shows the code you want to see, he has posted his code here: https://github.com/techwithtim/PygameForBeginners/blob/main/main.py
